# AnniePortfolio


## Setting up a portfolio page to present my works.

The page includes my name, picture & description, works of mine - with links to the corresponding page, and my contact details.


## The page

The page has a calming background image.
The page many elements such as nav, div, article, section, class and IDs.
The page is styled with, and not limited to various colors, fonts,opacities, flex-boxes, positions, varibles and hover function. The contents adjust to fit with all screen sizes. 
The header has rounded border-radius, to add some styles to the page.


## Section - Nav bar

Nav bar sections change style when user mouses over. 
Nav bar links take user to the corresponding sections of the page.
When screen size reduces, nav bar is positioned under my name.

## Section - About me

This section contains my photo and a short description about me.
I used various elements to devide the section so it's easier for user to read.
The first letter of each paragraph in description is bigger in size.
When screen size reduces, all elements wrap to fit and description comes under my picture.


## Section - My works

This section contains some of the mini projects I completed during the bootcamp. 
Again, I used various elements to devide the section so it's easier for user to read.
Each of the mini project is presented with a screenshot, which fades in when user mouses over. The screenshots are also built with links, to take user to the corresponding pages of my mini projects. The screenshots are titled for user's reference.
The first screenshot is bigger in size, as it's the most important one.
Similar to the above section, when screen size reduces, all elements wrap to fit and pictures (screenshots) are vertically positioned under the section title.


## Section - Contact me

This section is where the user can be in touch me. It includes my phone number, email address and Github - which is hyperlinked to my Github account.
This section also wraps when the screen size reduces.
